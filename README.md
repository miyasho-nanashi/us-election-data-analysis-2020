# us-election-data-analysis-2020
analysing US election 2020 
Overview
This project explores the 2020 US Presidential Election voting patterns across racial-majority counties. Using Python and statistical methods, the analysis aims to test and challenge common perceptions about voter demographics, particularly the claim that the Republican Party's support is predominantly from white voters.

Key Insights
White-majority counties showed the highest GOP support (~66.4% on average), aligning with traditional perceptions.
Surprisingly, Hispanic-majority counties also demonstrated strong GOP support (~56.7%), challenging the narrative that GOP policies alienate Hispanic voters.
Black and Asian-majority counties consistently had lower GOP support (~35%), with no significant differences between them.
Skills Demonstrated
Python Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation.
seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization.
scipy.stats and statsmodels for statistical analysis.
Statistical Methods:
ANOVA and Tukeyâ€™s HSD test to evaluate and compare group differences.
Data Visualization:
Heatmaps, box plots, and confidence intervals to present findings.
How to Reproduce
Clone this repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/us-election-data-analysis.git
cd us-election-data-analysis
Install required Python libraries:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:


jupyter notebook us_election_analysis.ipynb
Dataset
The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle: Ultimate US Election Dataset.

Future Improvements
Perform geographic breakdown (e.g., state-level Hispanic support analysis).
Include multivariate factors like income, education, and urban/rural splits.
Compare results with previous elections to identify trends.
Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of data-driven analysis to challenge stereotypes and uncover nuanced voting patterns. It also showcases skills in data science, statistical testing, and visualization.
